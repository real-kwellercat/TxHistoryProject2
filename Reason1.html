		<h1>How was texas Effected by Pearl Harbor???</h1>
		<P>
			The American naval base in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, was the target of a surprise attack by the Empire of Japan on
			December 7, 1941. Over 2,400 Americans lost their lives as a result of the attack, which also caused significant
			damage to the U.S. Pacific Fleet and the sinking of several battleships. The attack marked a turning point for the
			US as it triggered their involvement in World War II.
			<br />
			<br />

			Prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States had a policy of neutrality in the conflict. The day after
			the attack, President Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke to Congress, calling it "a date which will live in infamy" and
			asking for a war declaration against Japan. After that, Japan's allies Germany and Italy went to war.
			<br />
			<br />

			Many Texans volunteered to join the military in response to the call for troops. Texas played a significant role
			in the war effort, with over 750,000 Texans serving in the military over the course of the conflict. This was more
			than any other state, and a sizable portion of the soldiers serving in the Pacific Theater were from Texas.
			<br />
			<br />
			Overall, the attack on Pearl Harbor was a turning point in American history and had a significant impact on how
			World War II played out. The bravery and sacrifice of Texas residents and other Americans who participated in the
			war effort will always be remembered.
