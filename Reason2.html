		<h1>How did texas get effected by troops in training?</h1>
		<P>
			Texas developed into a center for military training and war-related industries during World War II, drawing farmers and citizens of small towns to create urban centers. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			The Great Depression was forgotten as the state saw a 33% increase in population, becoming more urban than rural. More than 750,000 Texans fought in the war, including notable generals like Adm. Chester W. Nimitz and Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Texas had 142 significant military installations. Five of the thirty-three Texans who received the Medal of Honor were of Latino descent, along with Audie Murphy and Cmdr. Samuel Dealey. Unfortunatelly, more than 22,000 Texans perished in the conflict.
