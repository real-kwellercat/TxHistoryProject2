		<h1>How did texas get effected by troops in training?</h1>
		<P>
			Texas soldiers distinguished themselves in a number of operational theaters during World War II, contributing
			significantly to the victory. One of the first units to see action was the Second Battalion, 131st Field Artillery
			of the Texas National Guard's 36th Infantry Division.
			<br />
			<br />
			When the Japanese invaded the Dutch East Indies in 1941, the battalion was sent to the Far East and captured on
			Java. The Lost Battalion was made up of members of the battalion and Houston cruiser survivors because they went a
			year without telling anyone back home what had happened to them. The 112th Cavalry Regiment, which was primarily
			made up of Texans, participated in fierce battles while guarding an air base in New Caledonia while serving on
			horseback in New Britain, Leyte, and Luzon.
			<br />
			<br />
			Another Texas unit, the First Cavalry Division, dismounted for the fight in the jungle, took Los Negros, and was
			the first to arrive in Manila when the Philippines were retaken. Also from Texas, the 103rd and 144th Infantry
			regiments saw a lot of action in the Pacific.
